# Sample Logging Project

The standard Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library is used widely in python programs for logging errors, displaying warning messages and debugging.

This simple demo shows how I use this library, instead of reinventing the wheel, to log information in a file with a custom name, location, and format from a running program.

A simple Q&A game, which I named `busybody`, is instantiated and run in `main.py`.  A random set of questions is posed and answers collected and logged. Each time the game is run, the log file is overwritten.

The directory structure for the root project:
```bash
tree
.
├── README.md
├── busybody.py			# houses the busybody game
├── logger.py			# houses the Logger class
├── logs
│   ├── busybody.log		# generated by the Logger object
│   └── tictactoe.log		# generated by the Logger object
├── main.py			# main python execution module
├── poetry.lock			# generated poetry dependency file
├── poetry.toml			# poetry configuration file
└── pyproject.toml		# poetry dependency file
└── tictactoe.py		# houses the tictactoe game
```

# Development Environment
This project uses
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [python](https://www.python.org/) version greater than `3.8.1`

to manage dependencies and create a virtual environment.

# Testing
To run this program, type `python main.py` in the terminal.

# Sample Game Session
```bash
$ python main.py
